# _Simple_ Page Application

An full client-side SPA made **simple**.

Just open the _index.html_ file with your web-browser.
No server, transpilation or whatever issue-prone concept.

This just works out of the 📦.

The technologies behind this:
- [RiotJS](https://riot.js.org) for web components made easy.
- [Riot Router](https://github.com/riot/route), a Vanilla basic routing system.
- [Milligram](https://milligram.io/) for CSS to make HTML natively beautiful.

It's very easy to plug this with an API for example.
